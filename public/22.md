# SSH (Secure Shell)

Port 22 is typically associated with the **SSH (Secure Shell)** protocol. SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows for secure remote access to systems and secure file transfers. It is commonly used for managing remote servers and devices securely.

SSH is a secure and encrypted protocol that provides a secure command-line login and remote execution environment. It enables users to log in securely to a remote system over an unsecured network, such as the internet, and execute commands as if they were physically present at the remote machine.

If port 22 is open on a system, it likely means that an SSH server is running, allowing authorized users to log in and perform administrative tasks or transfer files securely over the network.

Please note that while SSH is the most common application associated with port 22, it's possible for other services or applications to use this port as well. However, in most cases, it is SSH that you will find running on port 22.
