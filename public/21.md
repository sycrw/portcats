**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

FTP is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network, typically the internet. It enables users to:

- Upload
- Download
- Manipulate files and directories on a remote server

FTP operates on a client-server model, where the client:

1. Initiates a connection to the server
2. Authenticates itself
3. Performs various file operations like uploading, downloading, renaming, and deleting files

FTP can work in either **active** or **passive** mode, depending on the network configuration, and it uses a control connection (usually on port 21) for sending commands and a separate data connection for transferring actual file data.

Security concerns with FTP have led to the development of more secure alternatives like:

- **SFTP** (SSH File Transfer Protocol)
- **FTPS** (FTP Secure)

These alternatives encrypt the data transmission for improved privacy and security.
