# TCP Port Service Multiplexer (TCPMUX)

- **Port Number**: 1
- **Protocol**: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **Purpose**: Port 1 is a reserved port number in computer networking. It is historically associated with the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Port Service Multiplexer (TCP PSM). Unlike many other well-known ports, Port 1 does not have a specific application or service associated with it in modern networking.

In modern network configurations, Port 1 is often left unused or reserved for special purposes. If you encounter a specific application or service running on Port 1, it is essential to consult the relevant documentation or network administrator to understand its purpose and configuration.
