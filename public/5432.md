**PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its advanced features, extensibility, and robustness. It is highly regarded for its support of complex data types, extensible custom functions, and the ability to handle large volumes of data. PostgreSQL uses a SQL-based query language for data manipulation and retrieval and offers features like ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, transaction support, and concurrent processing. It is a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale enterprise databases, due to its reliability and community-driven development.
