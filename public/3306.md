**MySQL Protocol**

The MySQL protocol is a communication protocol used by MySQL database management systems to allow clients (applications or users) to interact with and query the MySQL database server. It operates over TCP/IP and includes various commands for tasks like connecting to the server, executing SQL queries, fetching query results, and managing transactions. The protocol defines a structured way for clients and servers to exchange information, making it possible for applications to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in MySQL databases efficiently.
